Jupyter 

What is it?
It’s a server-client application, that allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser. The application can be executed on a PC/MAC without internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where you can access it through the internet. 

Jupyter has two main components: The Kernel and Dashboard.

The Kernel is a program that runs and introspects the user’s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also other kernels available for other programming languages.

The Dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can see which ones are running and shut them down if necessary.

History of Jupyter

Python - Late 1980s - Guido Van Rossum begins to work on Python at the National Research Insitute(NRI) for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

IPython - Late 2001 - Fernando Perez starts developing IPython. Which, ended up becoming the name of the Python backend and a kernel for Jupyter.

Jupyter - 2014 - Fernando Perez announced a spin-off project from IPython called Project Jupyter. 

How to install Jupyter
-Run the following command in the Terminal 
pip3 install jupyter

Setup
In the Terminal, type in:
Jupyter notebook

Once you have the server up and running, look for the text that says
“Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=6bad7be1f33b54c62e3e6b997a90eb5c6c93046e2cc134a4”
Follow those instructions.
